## About
I have created this cheatsheet with intention of collecting python code snippets that I used on my projects/programs and from the internet for reducing coding hours and making other developers life easier.




String
------

### strip()
```python
<str>  = <str>.strip()           # removes characters from both left and right based on the argument

<str>  = <str>.strip('<chars>')  # removes all passed characters from both ends.

```



### ord()
```python
>>> ord('0'), ord('9')
(48, 57)
>>> ord('A'), ord('Z')
(65, 90)
>>> ord('a'), ord('z')
(97, 122)
```
